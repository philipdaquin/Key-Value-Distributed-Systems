# Project 4: Futures / Tokio and Asynchronous Networking  
Task: Create a multithreaded, persistent key/value store and client with an asynchrononous networking over a customer protocol

### Goals:
- Understand the patterns used when writing Rust futures
- Understand error handling with futures
- Learn to debug the type system
- Perform asynchronous networking with the tokio runtime
- Use boxed futures to handle difficult type-system problems
- Use impl Trait to create anonymous Future types
